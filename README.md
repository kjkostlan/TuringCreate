Turing Create aims to combine the world of graphical editing with programming. Blender is a wonderful tool, but in it and other tools the GUI and Python worlds are somewhat separated.

**Future planning** In Turing Create, these worlds will be inseparable. For example, extruding a face will *create a line of code* which can be then put into a for-loop that makes multiple extrusions with different parameters. Numerical parameters in the code will be able to be attached to draggable widgets, much like handles in an Illustrator/Inkscape curve. This provides flexibility without loosing the power of programming.



**This code is not at all functional yet** the next few commits will fix basic errors but a working product is a ways away.
