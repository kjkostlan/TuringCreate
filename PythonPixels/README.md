This is procedural texture library which has 90% or so of blender's procedural texture features built-in and is much more flexible because textures are snippits of Python code.

Several major features are planned. First of all, GIMP-like editing features could be useful to touch up textures. Secondly, the performance is very slow (single-core CPU) so CuPy could speed it up drastically. Finally, better integration of diffuse, specular, and normal maps would reduce the redundancy in the texture design.
